<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Abstract </h2>

We investigate a modelling framework to understand the fine-scale movement of the European badger (_Meles meles_) within their environment. It is widely understood that badgers play a crucial role in the transmission of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), where bTB is a serious disease of cattle and has a significant economic impact on farmers. However, despite all the GPS data, ecologists still do not understand what they can learn from the data about fine-scale badger movement. A key research question we would like to answer is can we generate a dynamical model to explore and understand better badger movement?

We model the movements of individual badgers using stochastic particle models on an energy surface. Such an approach has been successful in describing the movements of free-ranging elk and their avoidance of vehicles and humans, but has yet to be applied to the study of badgers. An exploratory modelling framework has been built that describes how badgers move around their landscape foraging, defaecating, and interacting with other badgers (including male and female differences). The model uses data driven methods to parametrize the energy surface using GPS data and the noisy random walks of badgers.

The modelling framework that we have created allow us to answer key ecological questions such as, how does badger movement affect the spread of bTB? With the role badgers play in the spread of bTB, the answer to these questions could be crucial in strategic planning of disease control.

In this presentation, we explore the results of the parameterized model and use it to investigate transition rates between badger social groups, where badgers cross various territories. We also discuss the pros and cons of the generation of an energy surface and the estimation of a noise term.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Generated Trajectory </h2>

Below is the animation linked to Figure 3, where the 'badger' can be seen to be moving along its trajectory. The initial position links to an individual badger that is being monitored at the park, and the diffusion term of the badger has been calculated. 

The animation is plotted every two iterations to show a smoother movement of the badger following its trajectory. This is a great tool to have a better visual of the badger movements in the park.
